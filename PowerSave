This demo shows how a Raspberry Pi Pico W can run several days (or even weeks) on battery power by using an Enable Timer TPL5111.
The timer will periodically wake up the Pico and shut it off once the Pico has finished the work. The periodical wake up time can be controlled 
by a potentiometer (or optionally by an external resistor). The power consumption of a TPL5111 is very low (below 50 ÂµA) and as such the run time 
of the Pico can be optimized for jobs that only take a few seconds and run periodically every houor (as an example).
