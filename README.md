The low power enable timer TPL5111 from Adafruit allows for extremly low energy to be "wasted" during times, when there is  no processing power needed. 
A Raspberry Pi Pico W for instance would typically require a current of 50mA or more during run time. There are several options to reduce the current via software. 
But all I have seen so far cannot bring the current below 1mA. theoretical a good battery pack of 2400mAh would give the Pico enough power to run 100 hours. 
But what if you want to run longer, without having the possibility to connect to a wired adapter?

Here is where the TPL5111 comes into pay, especially for applications, where the porcessing power of the Pico is not needed all the time. 
A good example is a simple temperature sensor. Usually temperature does not change much within a minute, so if we can shut ff the Pico for 10 minutes and then let it run for 30
seconds, then the ratio of on/off time becomes 1:20. So we assume that the battery life can be extended by the factor of 20. So, with the above mentioned 
battery pack a Pico consuming 50mAh in one hour will run a maximum of 48 hours continously until the battery is completely flat. 
Now with a TPL5111 we can basically ignore the power, which is consumed during idle times. As such the Pico will now run for max. 20x48 hours = 960 hours. 
This corresponds to 40 days and this is a much more acceptable value than 48 hours.
